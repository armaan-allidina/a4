        The concept was fonts and messages, I chose 3 different fonts and 3 different messages that were encoded differently in each composition, 
        with a different solving method for each one. For the animation I created a spear which I had move from one end of the screen to the other. 
        The feelings meant to be invoked are curiosity in order to solve the messages via decoding. 
        Each of the compositions have a different difficulty level toward them. 
        The colors I chose where the default colors for the font colors as those where what the assignment was to demonstrate, 
        the colors for the spear where chose with the important two being brown for the wood and grey for the tip, for the other 
        2 colors I used green and red from the RGB scale as I thought it would look better with some custom colors on the spear 
        without making it confusing on what it is. The spear relates to the last composition as that is the subject of the message. 
        The 2 variable fonts used have their variations shown with hover.
